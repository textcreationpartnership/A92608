            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Kingdom lyeth under the Burthen of great and vast expence, in raising and entertaining Armies, and hath with the losse of the lives of many precious men, set their own houses on fire to quench the flame of yours, and almost destroyed their own Nation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve yours; And seeing by the seasonable assistance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by this Kingdom to you, and by the late succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wherewith God hath blessed your Armies, you are in a great measure freed of your trouble, and are in a far better capacity to pay the Money due to our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> then you were at any time since the beginning of these Wars, I am likewise commanded by the Parliament of this Kingdom to demand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly do in their Name demand of the Honorable Houses of Parliament, to make payment before the Third of May next, of the sums of Money duly owing by them to this Kingdom, and their Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Treaties between the two Kingdoms (the Accompt whereof will be given in by our Commissioners) hat this Kingdom may be thereby relieved of the great I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r former Resolutions and Vows, but will live and dye with their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> in the prosecution of the ends expressed in the Solemn League and Covenant; Being confident of the like Inclination and Resolution of the Parliament and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> against all such groundless suspitions and needless Jealousies to the contrary, as bad Instruments, from the beginning to this day, have been, from their envy of our common hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and for their own private ends, inventing and suggesting, That all the common troubles which both Kingdoms have endured, may end in a publike Tragedy to the scandal and grief of the Reformed Churches, the hardning and strengthning of our common Enemies, the making of our selves the Instruments of our own mutual ruine and destruction, and, which is most of all, the dishonour of the great Name of our God, with whom we have entred in Covenant for the propagation of the Gospel, and the advancement of the Kingdom of his Son.</p>
            <p>For the present, according to the Trust committed unto us, we make our addresse to both Houses in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following, and do not doubt but we shall receive

Upon Information from our Commissioners there, The Parliament, before their adjourning, did understand what was written by one calling himself <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> and informed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, whose name was kept in the dark, and confirmed by a Letter of Mr. <hi>Jermin,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> against this Kingdom, their Army in <hi>England,</hi> and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners there, The accusations are of so high a nature, and so sophistically insinuated, that the Parliament, which, during their sitting, were upon all occasions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the best wayes of the preserving the happy Conjunction of the two Kingdoms, were much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, as a matter wherein they were much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, both for their own Vindication, and the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Brethren. If there shall be any matter or ground of such Accusation found against any person of this Kingdom, or our Army, or any of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, we are no lesse willing that it be examined, and punished to the full, then we desire and expect, that the like be done against any in <hi>England,</hi> that transgresse in that kinde, which is conform to our Covenant, wherein we all swear, <hi>With all faithfulnesse to endeavour the discovery of all such as have been, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by hindering the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or any of the Kingdoms from the other, that they may be brought to publike tryal, and receive condigne punishment, as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113706:6"/> so large and manifold experience; and in their several Letters to this Kingdom, did give them so ample testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; that no aspersion or suspitions lie upon them, by concealing the names of any persons who can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. And therefore, according to the Trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto us, We do desire in Name of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> (if that <hi>Robert Wright</hi> be not yet found out, who he is, and that <hi>hidden Knight</hi> after so long a time be not yet unsecreted, and made known by name) all means may be used for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the one; whose Letters have been so frequently produced before the Committee of both Kingdoms, and revealing the other to our Commissioners, which is in the power of some of the Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to do; that both Kingdoms may be satisfied, when the Truth is brought to light, and all such jealousies and misunderstandings may be prevented for the future.</p>
            <p>We do also represent to the Honorable Houses of Parliament, That this Kirk and Kingdom is more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized and grieved in the matter of Religion, which immediately concerneth God and his Honour, then in any thing on Earth, touching themselves and their own name.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Directory</hi> for the Worship of God is agreed upon in the Assembly, and Authorized by both Kingdoms, and practised carefully by this Church; but the <hi>Service Book</hi> still remained in some places of <hi>England,</hi> under the Parliaments power, and the <hi>Directory</hi> very much slighted, and by some avowedly written against. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the intended Unity in Religion, Basphemous Errors, Heresies, Sects, and Schisms are increased and multiplied through the want of Church Government.

When the Lord set your Honours upon the Bench of judgement, both the Kirk and Commonwealth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were afflicted with intestine and bosome evils, the care where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could not but be very difficult, because they were not onely many, but for the most part Universall and deeply rooted, sheltered under the shadow of custome and law, and supported with all the wisdome and strength of the Malignant and Prelaticall party; who rather choosed to involve the Land in an unnaturall and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy War, then to faile of their ambitious and treacherous designes against Religion, the priviledges of Parliament, and the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdome. Neither hath that miserable crew been wanting unto their own ends, but for many yeares together hath desperately pursued their resolutions in Armes; And was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have prevailed, if the Lord had not put himselfe in the breach, and furnished you with much patience, wisedome, courage, and constancy in the midst of many difficulties and distresses, and at last

               </gap>t you. These things as they be the matter of our refreshment and of your glory, So doe they lay a strong obligation upon your honours to walke humbly with your God, and to improve the power hee has put into your hands, for the advancement of the Kingdome of his Sonne, and bringing forth the head stone of his house. The slow progresse of the worke of God has alwayes beene the matter of our sorrow which is now encreased by the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the spirits of error and delusion, that drowne many souls in perdition, And so strengthen themselves that they shall afterward be laboured against, with more paines then successe, if a speedy and effectuall remedy be not provided. And therefore as the servants of the living God, who not onely send up our supplications dayly for you, but have hazarded our selves in your defence; Wee doe earnesty beseech your Honours in the bowels of Jesus Christ, to give unto him the glory that is due unto his Name, by a timeous esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing all his Ordinances in the full integrity and power thereof, according to the League and Covenant. As long as the Assembly of Divines was in debate and an Enemy in the Fields, wee conceave that these might be probable grounds of delay, which being now removed out of the way, wee doe promise our selves through your wisdome, faithfulnesse, and zeale, the perfecting of that which was the maine ground of our engagement, And a chiefe matter of consola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wee know that there is a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, who retard the worke of uniformity, and foment jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies betwixt the Nations, studying if it were possible, to breake our bonds asunder; But we trust that he that sitteth in the Heavens will laugh, and that the Lord will have them in derision; that hee shall speake to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; And notwithstanding of all that they can doe, set his King upon his holy Hill of Zion, and make these Nations happy in the sweet Fruits of Unity in Truth and Peace. The Searcher of hearts knowes, we desire to hold fast the band of our Covenant as Sacred and inviolable, being perswaded that the breach of so solemne a tie, could not but hasten downe upon our heads a curse and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur late and seasonable Testimony given to the truth of the Gospell, and your affection to the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, manifested in your humble Remonstrance and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Honourable Houses of Parliament, hath so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the remembrance of your former faith and zeale, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed you the worthy Seed of so Noble Ancestors in that famous City, as we cannot but acknowledge with all thankfulnesse the grace of God bestowed on you, and stirre you up to take notice, how since you were precious in the Lords sight, you have been ever honourable. The Lord hath ever loved you, given men for you, and people for your life; what a honour was it in the dayes of old when the fire of the Lord was in Zion, and his furnace in your Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem (even in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes) that there were found in you, men that loved not their lives unto the death; what a glory
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113706:11"/> in after times when Satan had his Throne, and Antichrist his Seat in the midst of you, that there were still found not a few that kept their garments cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne: But the greatest praise of the good hand of God upon you hath beene in this, that a midst the many mists of Error and Heresie, which have risen from the bottomlesse pit, to bespot the face and darken the glory of the Church, while the Bride is a making ready for the Lambe; you have held the truth, and most piously endeavoured the setling of Christ upon his Throne. We need not remember how zealous you have been in the cause of God, nor how you have laid out your selves and estates in the maintenance thereof, nor how many acknowledgements of the same, you have had from the honourable houses, nor how preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a remembrance will be had of you in after ages, for your selling of all to buy the pearle of price: We onely at this time doe admire and in the inward of our hearts doe blesse the Lord for your right and deepe apprehensions of the great and important matters of Christ in his Royall Crowne, and of the Kingdomes in their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while the Lord maketh offer to bring our Ship (so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and tossed with tempest) to the safe harbour of truth and peace. Right memorable is your zeale against Sects and Secturies, your care of reformation according to the word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches, your earnest endeavouring and noble adventures for preserving of the rights and priviledges of Parliament, and liberties of the Kingdomes, together with his Majesties just power and greatnesse, and your high profession, that it is not in the power of any hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne authority to discharge or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve you from adhereing unto that our so solemnely sworne League and Covenant, or to inforce upon you any sence contrary to the letter of the same: besides your other good services done to the Lord and to us, in strengthning the hands of the reverend assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, and of our Commissioners in their asserting of the government of Christ (which the more it be tried will be ever found the more precious truth) and vindicating of the same from the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation of man and contempt of the wicked. These all as they are so many testimonies of your Piety, Loyalty, and undaunted resolution to stand for Christ; so are they and shall ever be, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligations upon us your Brethren, to esteeme highly of you in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113706:12"/> the Lord, and to beare you on our brests before him night and day, and to contribute our best endeavours, and to improve all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for your encouragement. And now we beseech you in the Lord, Honourable and wel-beloved, goe on in this your strength and in the power of his might, who hath honoured you to be faithfull. Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and in pursuance of this truth, we are confident you will never cease to study the peace and neerer conjunction of the Kingdoms; knowing that a three-fold cord is not easily broken. Now the Lord Jesus Christ himselfe, and God even our Father which hath loved and honoured you, and given you everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and worke.</p>
